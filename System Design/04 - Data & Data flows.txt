Data remains at the core of any system.
data is in different forms in different layers -
In business layer - data is in form of img/video/text etc.
In application layer - data is in form of json, xml
In datastores (databases) - data is in the form of tables, indexes, trees, lists etc.
In network layer - data is in the form of packets.
In physical layer - data is in the form of 0's and 1's.

Throughout a session, data flows from one part of the system to other and it changes it's format.
Once the type of data, datastores required and data flow is understood, designing system is halfway done.

The different datastores -
1. databases 
2. queues
3. caches
4. indexes

The data stored in the datastores will flow from one component to other
for eg - from application to queue to DB, from cache to application etc
The different dataflow methods are -
1. API's
2. events
3. messages 

Now, we have to keep in mind that from where the data will flow and to which component so that the dataflow becomes efficient.
This depends on the kind of data u are storing and the kind of requirement the system has.
For example -
Databases - [userID, userName, userPhoneNumber, deptId]
Cache - [Request : response]
Queues - [send sms request, send email request, send print request]
Indexes - [most searched items, items searched in last 1 hour]


Data comes/generated from -
1. users - they interact with system, they enter data, delete data etc. like - calendar - user adds info to it. 
2. internal - data about data. for eg - logs of application, browsing history etc.
3. insights - generated by system from the existing data.

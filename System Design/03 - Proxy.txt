Proxy means "on behalf of"
A proxy is a hardware/software that sits between the client and the server.

A proxy is helpful in many ways - 
1. it helps in maintaining anonymity.
2. it helps in blocking certain sites / IP's.
3. it helps in caching the most frequent responses.
4. it helps in improving the security of the servers.
5. it helps in batch processing of requests.


There are 2 types of proxy -
1. Forward proxy - In this case, the proxy is on the client side. It is also called as client side proxy.
Here, client sends the requests to proxy, the proxy sends the request to the server, collects the response and then it gives the response back to client.
Benefits of using a forward proxy -
a. helps in bypassing organisation rules.
b. useful in blocking the access to certain sites.
c. maintains anonymity of the client. Server doesn't know the IP of the client.
d. Helpful in an organisation where many there are multiple clients, and these requests can be controlled and monitored.


2. Reverse proxy - In this case, the proxy is on the server side. It is also called as server side proxy.
Here, the client talks to the proxy, the proxy then talks to the servers, gets the response from the server and then gives it to the client.
Benefits of using a reverse proxy - 
a. helps in maintaining anonymity of the servers. The client doesn't know any of the IP addresses of the servers.
b. it is used for traffic control.
c. helps in caching the commonly requested content. This helps in improving the performance.
d. helps in load balancing.
e. increases the security of the servers like preventing against DDoS attacks.
f. it is used for SSL encryption etc.


Workarounds using proxies
1. on client side, the client can bypass the organisation rules/blocked websites.
2. on server side, if there are multiple servers and there is 1 proxy which is doing the load balancing; the proxy can become a cause of single point failure.
